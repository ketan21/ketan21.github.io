Hello 2015!
<br>

One of my new year resolution is to regularly write code and contribute to open source as much as possible. <br>
Also, this day marks 4 years of my Github presence.

Got OnePlus One invite code : INRY-XSVQ-9PTU-MTKB. I want to own this beast but then I don't want to discard my old faithful Galaxy Nexus.

Also today marks exactly 2 years when I first met Shon online.. never met him in person. He is one person I admire a lot.

Another Eventful day. Talking with childhood friends after long time feels so good. We all are lost in our own worlds busy in usual daily chores. <br>
Didn't realise time passed so quickly.<br>
